Visual artist and human being.

I work in diverse media and often in long series where each individual work layers on top of the rest. The inter-webs of the information revolution have fundamentally changed the way we experience reality. No longer linear it is constantly happening all around us, touching the individual from all corners of the globe.

But is it so new this layered existence. I wander often the wild corners of the American Southwest and I see evidence of layered, interconnected lives drawn upon the choicest rock walls and alcoves.

Working towards something far off and unknown and yet so so succinct.
