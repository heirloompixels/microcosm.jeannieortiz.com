We decorate ourselves and walk forward in this world proud of who we are. Adornment is the most personal of all art as you wear it, you adopt the art to tell a piece of your own story. I’m honored when people wear my creations.

I am a silversmith and do all the silver work in the below work. I’m interested in hand forming metal with anvils and carefully made stakes. I love the anticlastic form and granulation.

All beading is done by my partner Jeannie Ortiz. I make the metal bits and she makes the rest amazing.
